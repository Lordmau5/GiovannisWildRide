Giovanni's Wild Ride - The official game!

I blame Twitch for making me do this.

A puzzle-game about the spin-tiles from the original Pokemon game.  
  
Includes a Level Editor, so people can go crazy on a 32x24 tile-space with their ideas.  
All open for suggestions, just pop them in the *Issues* with a proper suffix :P
